In this repository I keep all pieces of code I showed during my speech on International School on Quantum Computing 2020 by RQC.
This repository includes:
1. [Tensors in TensorFlow](https://colab.research.google.com/github/LuchnikovI/RQC_School_Rapid_prototyping/blob/master/1_Tensors_in_TensorFlow.ipynb)
2. [Optimization of spin echo](https://colab.research.google.com/github/LuchnikovI/RQC_School_Rapid_prototyping/blob/master/2_Optimization_of_spin_echo.ipynb)
3. [Ground state search with automatic differentiation](https://colab.research.google.com/github/LuchnikovI/RQC_School_Rapid_prototyping/blob/master/3_Ground_state_of_spin_chain.ipynb)
